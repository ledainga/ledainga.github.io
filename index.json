A large body of empirical literature in urban economics suggests that lower transit costs may enhance labor market outcomes by encouraging jobseekers to search farther away from home and accept jobs with otherwise high commuting costs. These mechanisms are likely to be particularly relevant for cash-constrained jobseekers relying on public transport. In this research, I thus focus on young jobseekers claiming (means-tested) unemployment assistance benefits. To examine the effects of subsidized transit on their future labor market outcomes, I exploit a policy change in the region of Madrid, increasing the age limit to benefit from a youth discount on public transport and setting a flat price for all youth travel passes.","tags":["Unemployment","Policy Evaluation","Regression Discontinuity Design"],"title":"The effects of subsidized transit on the unemployed youth: A regression discontinuity design","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leda Inga"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1675209600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675209600,"objectID":"337b2dabb1547c6bf95757d3fc757aee","permalink":"https://leda-inga.github.io/publication/barcelona/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/barcelona/","section":"publication","summary":"Policymakers typically use active labor market policies, such as training and job-search assistance, to help the unemployed find work. Nonetheless, these are often costly and have shown modest effects. In this research, I assess the employment effect of a low-cost and straightforward intervention: subsidized public transport for cash-constrained jobseekers. In particular, I exploit a natural experiment in Catalonia in 2012 that reduced transit costs for unemployment assistance recipients. Using three complementary empirical approaches (difference-in-differences, the synthetic control method, and the synthetic difference-in-differences method), I find that the transport subsidy offered in Catalonia brought meaningful employment gains concentrated on younger assistance recipients. These gains ranged from 18% to 25% of their estimated counterfactual outcome, three to twenty-four months after entering unemployment. Finally, I also find suggestive evidence that these employment gains did not come at the expense of lower earnings.","tags":["Unemployment","Policy Evaluation","Difference-in-Differences","Synthetic Control","Synthetic Difference-in-Differences"],"title":"The employment effect of subsidized transit on unemployment assistance recipients","type":"publication"},{"authors":["anastasia-litina","Leda Inga"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1655372700,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655372700,"objectID":"fb8cb5e834d680fbd2b3d9f26c042722","permalink":"https://leda-inga.github.io/talk/celestial-enlightenment-eclipses-curiosity-and-economic/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/celestial-enlightenment-eclipses-curiosity-and-economic/","section":"event","summary":"This paper revisits the role of human capital for economic growth among pre-modern ethnic groups.

This scheme entitles youths with no or little labor market experience to unemployment beneﬁts after a waiting period of one year. As of 2015, the Belgian government unexpectedly scrapped beneﬁt eligibility for youths who start the waiting period at the age of 24 or older. The reform implied a change from an inclining to a ﬂat rate (zero-level) beneﬁt proﬁle. We use a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences approach to identify the causal impact of this reform on fresh university graduates. Our main ﬁnding is that this reform only increases the transition to very short-lived jobs.","tags":["Youth unemployment","Unemployment insurance","Policy Evaluation","Difference-in-differences"],"title":"","type":"publication"}]
