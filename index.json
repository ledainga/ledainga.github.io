Using a regression discontinuity design in the Spanish region of Madrid, I examine the short-term effects of a price cut in public transport that reduced job search and commuting costs for unemployed youths under 26. In particular, I compare the future labor market outcomes of unemployed assistance recipients who were laid off just before and after turning 26. Results suggest that subsidized transit may bring meaningful employment gains for young assistance recipients. Specifically, I estimate a (local) treatment effect of 23 percentage points on the job-finding probability and 30 days on the number of cumulative days in work six months after layoff. Finally, I find supporting evidence that these gains are driven by increased geographical mobility among those living farther away from jobs.","tags":["Unemployment","Policy Evaluation","Regression Discontinuity Design"],"title":"The effects of subsidized transit on the unemployed youth: A regression discontinuity design","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leda Inga"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1675209600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675209600,"objectID":"337b2dabb1547c6bf95757d3fc757aee","permalink":"https://leda-inga.github.io/publication/barcelona/","publishdate":"2023-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/barcelona/","section":"publication","summary":"Policymakers typically use active labor market policies, such as training and job-search assistance, to help the unemployed find work. Nonetheless, these are often costly and have shown modest effects. In this research, I assess the employment effect of a low-cost and straightforward intervention: subsidized public transport for cash-constrained jobseekers. In particular, I exploit a natural experiment in Catalonia in 2012 that reduced transit costs for unemployment assistance recipients. Using three complementary empirical approaches (difference-in-differences, the synthetic control method, and the synthetic difference-in-differences method), I find that the transport subsidy offered in Catalonia brought meaningful employment gains concentrated on younger assistance recipients. These gains ranged from 18% to 25% of their estimated counterfactual outcome, three to twenty-four months after entering unemployment. Finally, I also find suggestive evidence that these employment gains did not come at the expense of lower earnings.","tags":["Unemployment","Policy Evaluation","Difference-in-Differences","Synthetic Control","Synthetic Difference-in-Differences"],"title":"The employment effect of subsidized transit on unemployment assistance recipients","type":"publication"},{"authors":["anastasia-litina","Leda Inga"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1655372700,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655372700,"objectID":"fb8cb5e834d680fbd2b3d9f26c042722","permalink":"https://leda-inga.github.io/talk/celestial-enlightenment-eclipses-curiosity-and-economic/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/celestial-enlightenment-eclipses-curiosity-and-economic/","section":"event","summary":"This paper revisits the role of human capital for economic growth among pre-modern ethnic groups.

This scheme entitles youths with no or little labor market experience to unemployment beneﬁts after a waiting period of one year. As of 2015, the Belgian government unexpectedly scrapped beneﬁt eligibility for youths who start the waiting period at the age of 24 or older. The reform implied a change from an inclining to a ﬂat rate (zero-level) beneﬁt proﬁle. We use a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences approach to identify the causal impact of this reform on fresh university graduates. Our main ﬁnding is that this reform only increases the transition to very short-lived jobs.","tags":["Youth unemployment","Unemployment insurance","Policy Evaluation","Difference-in-differences"],"title":"Switching from an inclining to a zero-level unemployment beneﬁt proﬁle: Good for work incentives?","type":"publication"}]
